# RinomXE general
RinomXE is 3 or more dimensional Euclidean graphics. It may almost be called unbounded dimensional graphics or infinite dimensional graphics but computers are finite and therefore it can only simulate what your computer is capable of. It operates on whole shapes and draw orders on averages so it is somewhat inaccurate. For more information visit [RinomXE website](https://gugquettex.com/en/project/rinomxe/index.php). It is licensed under this [Software License](https://gugquettex.com/en/project/software-license.php). If you don't want to visit my website, license is basically MIT with no attribution. Ruby x version is faster and without semicolons. tryXE.rb uses RinomXE Ruby and Ruby2d to draw some things. Unless it is named Rinom...XE it is not RinomXE and is tests. There is one file per each RinomXE version. Associated with each language of RinomXE are extensions, test....js is Javascript, only one that does not follow this is testXE.html which is for Javascript RinomXE. Note that unless you find a compiler such as DragonRuby, mRuby, or some Javascript compiler, Ruby and Javascript versions are too slow to be practical. X E.
