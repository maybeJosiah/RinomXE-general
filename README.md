# RinomXE general
RinomXE is 3 or more dimensional Euclidean graphics, many dimensional graphics. It may almost be called unbounded dimensional graphics or infinite dimensional graphics but computers are finite and therefore it can only simulate what your computer is capable of. It operates on whole shapes and draw orders on averages so it is somewhat inaccurate. For more information visit [RinomXE website](https://gugquettex.com/en/project/rinomxe/index.php).

Ruby x version is faster and without semicolons. tryXE.rb uses RinomXE Ruby and Ruby2d to draw some things. Unless it is named Rinom...XE it is not RinomXE and is a test. There is one file per each RinomXE version. Associated with each language of RinomXE are extensions, test10000XE.js is Javascript, only one that does not follow having same extension as it tests is testXE.html which is for Javascript RinomXE. Note that unless you find a compiler such as DragonRuby, mRuby, or some Javascript compiler, Ruby and Javascript versions are too slow to be practical.

## How to use this in pseudocode:

var drawer=new RinomDrawXE(eyes point, view plane center, x,y,z dimensions,initial point capacity, initial shape capacity);

drawer.addPoint(point);

//do many, all points same dimension number

drawer.addShape(shape);

//do many, indices of points

drawer.setPoints2d(round with float, whether to round, precision padding float);

drawer.reverse x or y();

drawer.offset([x,y]);

drawer.setDrawOrder();

//Next go from drawer.drawOrder end to start, each index is a shape, use drawer.points2d same indices as points input in their order.

drawer.reset();

//And you are done this draw call
X E.
